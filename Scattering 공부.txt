Scattering = excitation + reradiation
Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem
Linearly birefringment: different refractive indices depending on the state of liner polarization
Linearly dichroic: the imaginary parts of the refractive indices are different
Circularly birefringent & circularly dichroic: complex refractive index depends on handedness

Scattering = excitation + reradiation
Ewald-Oseen extinction theorem
Linearly birefringment: different refractive indices depending on the state of liner polarization
Linearly dichroic: the imaginary parts of the refractive indices are different
Circularly birefringent & circularly dichroic: complex refractive index depends on handedness
Stokes parameters
extinction depends pn the chemical composition of the particles, their size, shape, orientation, the surrounding medium, the number of particles, and the polarization state and frequency of the incident beam.
natural frequencies of the sphere
at the wavelength of magnetic resonance, the excited magnetic dipole mode of a dielectric nanoparticle may become comparable to, or even stronger than, the electric dipole response.

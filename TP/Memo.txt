1. Find the incidnet and transmitted THz field spectra by Fourier transform
- use MATLAB Fourier transform

txt file format: time reference sample
time interval: 33.3fs -> 30 THz

* sample has 2nd, 3rd signal because of internal refelction
-> make absortion peak to spectra
-> delete extra signal -> what is standard?

condition:
- plane wave
- Air's index = 1 (n0)
- 737.5um


2. Find the transmission coefficient
- By definition, just divde incident and transmitted
- some value will over 1 -> meaningless value (noise)

- A complex coefficient means that a phase shift is introduced at the interface upon reflection (or transmission). (Cheng, p.399)

3. Find the complex refractive index
- use wave-vector
- In most semiconductors are lossy medium -> think absorption coefficient
